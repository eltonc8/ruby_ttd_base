# Ruby TTD Base
### A Basic Development Skeleton

This provides a basic framework to begin development with unit tests. Rspec, Guard, and Byebug are conveniently included.

### Setup & Usage

1. Configure the Gemfile. Ensure the proper version of ruby and bundler are installed and used.
2. Run command `bundle install` to install gems.
3. Run command `rspec` to run specs.

#### Using Guard

1. Run `bundle exec guard init` to generate an empty `Guardfile`.
2. Run `bundle exec guard` on a terminal to automate tests.
